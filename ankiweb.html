This add-on allows to delay/postpone updates for selected add-ons.

This might be useful if you have made some custom modifications to installed add-ons and you want to delay an update which would overwrite these modifications. This might be useful if you're curious what an update changed because some add-ons only have minimal documentation so that sometimes looking at the source code is informative. Maybe it's also useful if you worry about security, see e.g. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/gx3ocl/anki_addons_safe/" rel="nofollow">this discussion</a>.

<b># Configuration</b>
There are some options in the config that are disabled by default. You can e.g. enable to automatically diff the addons folder before and after the update. For this the add-on can copy the addons folder to a temp folder before updating. This feature is untested and since it optionally deletes file be careful before using it.

<b># Compatibility</b>
This add-on overwrites two functions from Anki - namely "handle_update_info" and "prompt_to_update" from aqt.addons.

<b># Alternatives</b>
There's also the add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/260702380" rel="nofollow">Addons update picker</a></b> by epiphanie-gedeon. Both add-ons serve a similar purpose and were made by accident at the same time. 

<b># bugs</b>
Use this version at your own risk. This add-on is newly released and virtually no one has downloaded it so far. Please do not use reviews for bug reports or support requests. I don't get notified of your reviews, and properly troubleshooting an issue through them is nearly impossible (formatting is limited and I can't reply multiple times). If you find a bug let me know on <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__postpone_delay_addon_update_for_selected/issues" rel="nofollow">github</a> or via reddit (/u/ijgnord).
