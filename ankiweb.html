This add-on allows to delay/postpone updates for selected add-ons. For some motivation see e.g. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/gx3ocl/anki_addons_safe/" rel="nofollow">this discussion</a>.

<b># Compatibility</b>
This add-on overwrites two functions from Anki - namely "handle_update_info" and "prompt_to_update" from aqt.addons.

<b># bugs</b>
Use this version at your own risk. This add-on is newly released and virtually no one has downloaded it so far. Please do not use reviews for bug reports or support requests. I don't get notified of your reviews, and properly troubleshooting an issue through them is nearly impossible (formatting is limited and I can't reply multiple times). If you find a bug let me know on <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__postpone_delay_addon_update_for_selected/issues" rel="nofollow">github</a> or via reddit (/u/ijgnord).
